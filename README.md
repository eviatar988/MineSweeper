# MineSweeper

Minesweeper
Welcome to the improved Minesweeper game! As part of the graduation project in the software engineering course, we have enhanced the classic game with new features to make it more interesting and challenging!

Purpose of the Game
The aim of the game is to reveal all the squares on the board while avoiding mines, with as few interactions with the mines as possible, and in the fastest time.

How to Play
Starting the Game:

The game starts with a square board containing a number of squares based on the difficulty level:
Easy: Few squares.
Hard: Many squares.
Each slot can have a mine (there are 3 types of mines) or be empty.
Playing the Game:

Click on a slot to reveal it.
If the slot contains a mine, you will lose lives according to the type of mine.
If the slot does not contain a mine, it will be revealed.
If the square is adjacent to mines, a number will appear indicating the number of adjacent mines.
Use this information to uncover other slots strategically.
Continue uncovering tiles until you have revealed all the tiles without triggering any mines.
Tips
Time and Lives: Keep an eye on the time and your remaining lives, displayed at the top of the screen.
Flags: If unsure whether a slot contains a mine, mark it with a flag.
Revealing Adjacent Squares: If you come across a square with a number, you can reveal all adjacent squares by clicking on the numbered square.
How to Win
You win the game if you reveal all the squares without losing all your lives.
